                            We want Tetraflip to be a safe and welcoming space for programmers. Having a Code of Conduct makes the process of reporting incidents as simple as possible and provides guidelines for behavior at events.

                            While you do have the option of working alone, Hackathon is a team event so working with others is encouraged. Tetraflip is a team event,so a team of 2-4 is encouraged.
